# Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first name,
# a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a
# method called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by default but also
# accepts a different raise amount. Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods,
# test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t
# have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make
# sure both tests pass.

class Employee:

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, annual_salary=0):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.annual_salary = annual_salary

    def give_raise(self, special_raise=0):
        if special_raise:
            self.annual_salary = self.annual_salary + special_raise
        else:
            self.annual_salary = self.annual_salary + 5000
