# •	 Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous 
# chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their 
# meanings as values.
# •	 Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might 
# print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word 
# on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the 
# newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning 
# pair in your output.
